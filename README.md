# Dabetes_Detection Using Machine Learning

# Why is The preventation and Early detection of diabetes so important?

If uncontrolled, diabetes can damage your heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves.
This is why it is so important to get screened for diabetes and take steps to prevent it if you are identified to be at increased risk.
 Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood sugar, or glucose, is too high.

Machine learning methods are widely used in predicting diabetes, and they get preferable results.
Decision tree is one of popular machine learning methods in medical field, which has grateful classification power. 
Random forest generates many decision trees. Neural network is a recently popular machine learning method, which has a better performance in many aspects. 
So in this Project, I have  used  random forest (RF) ,Logistic Regressioin and K Neighbor classifier.

# Random Forest:
RF generates many decision trees, which is very different from decision tree algorithm . When the RF is predicting a new object based on some attributes, 
each tree in RF will give its own classification result and ‘vote,’ and then the overall output of the forest will be the largest number of taxonomy.
 In the regression problem, the RF output is the average value of output of all decision trees.

# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is one of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms for binary classification problems,
which are problems with two class values, including predictions such as “this or that,” “yes or no” and “A or B.”

# K Neighbor Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. 
This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.


# Conclusion
Diabetes mellitus is a disease, which can cause many complications. How to exactly predict and diagnose this disease by using machine learning is worthy studying.
